# -------------------------------------------- INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON ---------------------------------------------------

# ******** WHAT IS PYTHON? **********

# 1. Python is general purpose high level programming language.
# 2. It is an interpreted interactive, object-oriented programming language.
# 3. It is designed to be highly readable, with a syntax that emphasizes simplicity and clarity.
# 4. It was created by GUIDO VAN ROSSUM AND WAS RELEASED IN 1991.He was born in Haarlem, Netherlands on 31st January,1956.

# ********** USES OF PYTHON ***************

# 1. Data Science and Data Analytics
# 2. web development and software development
# 3. Machine learning and Artificial intelligence
# 4. Automation and Scripting


# *********** What can Python do? **************

# 1. Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
# 2. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
# 3. Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
# 4. Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
# 5. Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.



# *************** Why Python? *********************

# 1. Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
# 2. Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
# 3. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than 
# 	some other programming languages.
# 4. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as 
# 	it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
# 5. Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.



# **************** How to Install Python? *********************

#  1. Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads
#  2. Download the latest version for your operating system
#  3. Run the installer and make sure to check the box: "Add Python to PATH"
#  4. After installation, open your terminal and type `python --version` to verify


# ****************** Python IDEs and Editors ************************

# You can write Python code using various tools:
# - VS Code (most popular, lightweight)
#  - PyCharm (feature-rich IDE)
# - Jupyter Notebook (best for data science)
# - IDLE (comes built-in with Python)
